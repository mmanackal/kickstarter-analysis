# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to know how different campaigns peformed compared to their goals and launch dates. An analysis was performed for Louise to report comparisons and trends. 
### Purpose
The is to provide an analysis and visual representation of outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
As seen below, the summer months, have the most successful campaign outcomes for plays. The graph below shows May to be the peak month year over year. The analysis doesn't show us if there is a particular sub category that does well in May and this is a limitation of the data set we used.

When analyzing outcomes vs goals, it appears that the best outcomes were between 0 to 4,999 and 35,000 to 44,999. These results are graphically represented below. We analyzed the subcategory 'Plays' and its difficult to interpret if the other subcategories within theater would have bumped up other goals to being more successful. Another limitation of the dataset we used is not knowing when these 'Play' campaigns were launched. As we learned in the previous dataset, its possible that the successful goals did better during particular times of the year. If we know when, then Louise can maximize her launches for plays during that time and for the goal amounts that did well.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater outcomes were best between April and August. The peak month of pledges happens in May. The summer appear to be the better months to launch theater campaigns.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The 40,000 to 49,000 campaign goal failed so this might not be a reasonable goal range for plays. The most successful goals were 0 to 4,999 and 35,000 to 44,999. In the future, Louise may want to launch more projects within these goal categories for plays. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When analyzing the outcomes vs goals data, it was easy to miss a criteria when developing the formula because there were more than 2 at times. This is an area that mistakes can be made very easily and you would never know unless you filter, sort, and check the raw data.
## Results
For the theater launch, May is the most successful month followed by the summer months. Its possible more people are interested in theater due to summer breaks and having the ability to see a musical or play. Its easier to campaign and gain pledges for something while people are partaking in the event. Theater being something a family can enjoy together may also encourage people to pledge so that it is around for their children in the future. The results from outcomes based on goals show that smaller campgaign goals are very successful. It appears the people donating may have discretionary income below $1000 and thus Louise may want to launch more campaigns in these goal categories.
As mentioned earlier, a limitation of Outcomes vs Launch is not looking at the subcategories in relation to the launch date. Its possible that certain subcategories did better during the summer month and good for Louise to know so she can put more resources towards those launches. It would be nice to see a graphical comparison of the subcategories and their launch dates as well. A limitation of the outcomes vs goals is that it limited the analysis to one sub category and didn't look at the timeline of launch. It would have been helpful to see if other subcategories did well for goals that didn't do well for plays. This would like Louise know to launch campaigns for other subcategories under theater which didn't do so well for plays.
